# No updates?

What happened? There are no recent posts.

Truth being told I started some blog posts on my adventure with [Ember.js](http://www.emberjs.com) but  never finished. Now that Ember 2.0 is out these posts are already outdated.

Also, this blog is using [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com) and it is not as user friendly as it could be. No 'press a button and write along'-experience. I was thinking to switch to [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) but found [prose.io](http://prose.io) which I am trying with this post.

Let's see how it goes. I payed more with Docker and was thinking to move all my dev environments there. That could be a nice post. That hopefully does not outdate so quickly :)
