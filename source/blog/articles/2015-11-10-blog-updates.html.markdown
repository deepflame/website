Truth being told I started some blog posts on my adventure with [Ember.js](http://www.emberjs.com) but  never finished. Now that Ember 2.0 is out these posts are already outdated.

Also, this blog is using [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com) and it is not as user friendly as it could be. No 'press a button and write along'-experience. I was thinking to switch to [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) but found [prose.io](http://prose.io) which I am trying with this post.

Let's see how it goes. I played more with [Docker](https://www.docker.com) and was thinking to move all my dev ironments there. That could be a nice post. That hopefully does not outdate so quickly :)

Seems that prose.io [does not support Middleman](https://github.com/prose/prose/issues/561) yet, just Jekyll. Well, so my hunt to a less painful blog experience continues.

This blog post did not build because the date in the frontmatter did not match the one in the file name. Does it make sense to keep it in two places?

For some reason I had the wrong file extension. Should be `.html.markdown` and not only `.markdown`. Learned something new again :)

Hay, we have winter time now in Germany. So the date in the frontmatter was in the future and the post was not build...

So the rendering is not the same in every markdown editor. Guess I made some changes to the rendering config. Ok, so firing up Middleman and using the Livereload feature helps.
