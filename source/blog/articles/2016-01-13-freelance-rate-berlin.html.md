Lately I had discussions again about freelance rates for developers here in Berlin. "Freelance rates are so high! I rather have a full time employee.". Well, are freelancers really that expensive?
Let's calculate the expenses of a full time employee and compare this to a freelancer, shall we?

## Expenses for a fulltime employee

Currently the yearly wage of a software engineer here in Berlin is [around 50k EUR][a] gross, seniors [earning around][b] [10k more][c].
This is what the employee will receive gross, minus tax and insurances. The employer has his own share that he needs to pay in addition. That would be around 21% on top.

Let's assume a yearly salary of 55k EUR for the employee, the employer would have to pay:

```
55.000 EUR * 1.21 = 66.550 EUR
```

Plus all the extras: 

- desk
- technical equipment
- training & personal development
- conference tickets
- office supplies like paper
- coffee

Surely some also apply to freelancers if they work at the customer site.

## Equivilent daily and hourly rates

To compare a bit better let's calculate the equivilent daily and hourly rate.

Working days per year in Germany:

```
total days per year:		365
Saturdays per year:			 52
Sundays per year:			 52
Public holidays:			 10
Vacation days:				 25
Sickleave:					  5

Total working days:			221
```

So the daily rate would be:

```
66.550 EUR / 221 days ~ 300 EUR/day
```


If we have 8 daily working hours we get an hourly rate of:

```
300 EUR/day / 8 hours/day = 37.50 EUR/hour
```

"But freelancers charge way more than that!"

That is true, and they do it for `a good reason`. This is an hourly rate of someone working `productively for 8 hours EVERY day`! Generating value for the company every minute he or she is at work. We all know that `this is not the case`.

## Productive hours only

So the question arises:

How many hours can we work/develop productively? Great that this question was [asked already][1] on [the internet][2] in [several places][3].

Turns out that most people think they can program for about 4-6 hours per day. 6 being really good.

Development is brainintensive work and we cannot program all day long. Most of the time the best ideas come also during a break while relaxing.
But would you pay a freelancer for relaxing or doing unproductive work?

Surely not!

You pay a freelancer for productive work that brings value to your company.

So, if a freelancer would/could invoice 4 hours of productive work every day he would have to charge `double the calculated hourly rate` to receive as much as a full time employee.

And this is for working every day, and even a full time employee is not productive every day. He may get side tracked by other "shiny things" that employers at the end pay for. But this is a different story...

## Worth the money

So, `don't be surprised` when freelancers ask for 60 - 90 EUR/hour.

At the end of the day it is the result that matters and not about how many hours someone worked. It is the value that a person brings to the company - so, if a skilled, motivated freelancer can give that why not pay them accordingly?

They are surely worth it!
