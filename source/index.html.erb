  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Hi there! I'm doing consulting and development for the web and mobile platforms, focussing on Ruby on Rails, EmberJS and Phoenix Framework.
  </p>
  <p>
    Currently my family and I reside in Berlin, Germany.
  </p>
  <p>
    The last 7 years I had the opportunity to live outside the country in Northern Europe and South East Asia.
    I did a lot of support, installations and training for an international operating software company.
  <p>
    Coming from a development background I started with PHP and Java, later I was coding mostly with <span id="dev-rails" class="dev">Ruby / Rails</span> for internal projects.
  </p>
  <p>
    End of 2011 I started with <span id="dev-ios" class="dev">iOS</span> development, trying to use as much <span id="dev-html5" class="dev">HTML5</span> as possible to be platform independent.
  </p>
    Bringing together my passion for good customer relationships and beautiful functional applications I am happy to offer my services for development, consulting and training.
