<section class="about">
  <h2>Hi there!</h2>

  <p>
    I am a people-oriented software engineer and consultant with around <%= Date.today.year - 2003 %> years of experience in the industry.
    I had the opportunity to work in different areas of software companies with Enterprise clients and Startups.
  </p><p>
    My expertise ranges from development, customer support, professional services, pre-sales to technical leadership.
  </p><p>
    With this broad experience I currently work as a DevOps engineer, helping companies to deploy faster and developers to be more productive.
  </p><p>
    In my spare time I enjoy being with my wife and 4 kids, doing photography, leading a small group in church, playing the guitar and hacking on my side project when time permits.
  </p><p>
    If you think we would be a good fit and that I could help you to bring your business forward please don’t hesitate to contact me. I would be glad to contribute.
