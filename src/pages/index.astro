    <h2>Hi there!</h2>

    <p>
      I am a people-oriented software engineer and consultant with around {new Date().getFullYear() - 2003} years of experience in the industry.
      I had the opportunity to work in different areas of software companies with Enterprise clients and Startups.
    </p><p>
      My expertise ranges from development, customer support, professional services, pre-sales to technical leadership.
    </p><p>
      With this broad experience I currently work as a DevOps engineer, helping companies to deploy faster and developers to be more productive.
    </p><p>
      In my spare time I enjoy being with my wife and 4 kids, doing photography, leading a small group in church, playing the guitar and hacking on my side project when time permits.
    </p><p>
      If you think we would be a good fit and that I could help you to bring your business forward please donâ€™t hesitate to contact me. I would be glad to contribute.
    </p>
